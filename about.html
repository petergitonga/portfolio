           <p class="intro">Hey there! I'm guessing that you are intrested in knowing about me and why i regard to myself
           as the designated one. I'll begin from my childhood history so backle up for an interesting
           journey to the <strong>"GITONGA WORLD!"</strong>
           First i would like to clarify the meaning of my name and where it came from;
           <ul>
               <li>peter means "THE ROCK"</li>
               <li>njagi means "ZEBRA"</li>
               <li>gitonga means"RICH MAN</li>
           <span>In my community, the name "Gitonga" is believed to be given to people destined for greatness.
           I thought you should know.</span>
           </ul></p>

           <p class="back">I'll start by a brief history on my educational background. I was born in the late 90's and a
           few years later i joined a nursery school and started my primary school course in <strong>"Musa Gitau primary school"</strong>
           Apparently at that time, my mum was the deputy principal in the school. I had to finish my primary school
           course in that school by default since both my older brother and sister had experienced the
           same. 8 years later i completed my primary school course and i qualified to join a county
           government high school.</p>

           <p class="education">Later on the next year, i joined <strong>"Nguviu boys high school"</strong>. The school is located in the mount kenya
           region in embu. You can imagine the cold and severe weather in the place having lived in Nirobi
           all your life. After 2 years i was unable to adapt to the freezing weather especially in the
           morning. I therefore requested for a transfer and i joined <strong>"Anestar High School"</strong>. After 2 years,
           i completed my high school course in Anestar with flying colours.</p>

           <p class="moringa">Now this year, i applied to join the university to pursue IT as my degree course which i was
           succssesfully accepted by the <em>"University of Nairobi [UON]"</em>. Meanwhile, i was doing driving
           and one day i came across a friend who was attending classes here at Moringa school and she
           triggered my interest about coding. Back then when i was in high school i was so much into
           medicine since my dad was a doctor and i liked everything about what he did. As i advanced into
           form 3, i realised that my passion was more in IT than in medicine and so i decide to join <strong>moringa
           school</strong> so that i could strengthen my degree with this course and also keep myself busy with
           something i like doing as i await to join the university. Checkout this project i have been working on <a href="https://petergitonga.github.io/my-pet-website/">Pet Website</a> </p>

           <p class="skills"> I have many hobies but i'll just touch on a few aspects that i love doing most of the time;
           <ol>
               <li>swimming</li>
               <li>hanging out with my peers</li>
               <li>travelling</li>
               <li>listening to trap music</li>
           </ol>
           <p class="summ">One skill i am actually very perfect at is playing basketball. I improve this skill daily by
           attending and participating in "basketball SPRITE CHALLENGES" That is now the real picture of who i am in a summarized way.</p>
